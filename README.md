# Rubiks-Cube
Algorithm that solves a Rubiks cube using the beginners method

Current Goal:
- To finish the algorithm

Steps needed to complete that goal:
- Implement Computer Vision

Additional changes that I would like to make:
- Test the code further
    • Tested with randomized testing, would run the code 10,000 times in a row with no errors
    • Would like to do further unit testing
- Add the yellow daisy step
    • Done
- Implement Computer Vision
    • Incomplete 
- Clean up the code
    • Partially complete, needs more work
    • Reduce repetitive lists/dictionaries by having them as global
    • Potentially combine helper functions that are similar
    • Descriptive and concise comments
- Make the algorithm more efficient and take less steps
    • Incomplete
    • Will start by deleting redundant steps (like F followed by F' on same side does nothing)
    • Skip steps like Yellow Daisy / Switch algorithm to non beginner algorithm
